    <h2>Controller</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Play with whatever input method you are comfortable with</li>
      <li>Keyboard is valid and can be easier to do clean inputs with, but if you are more comfortable with a controller use that instead</li>
      <li>On a traditional console controller, rebind the dash macro to a button or bumper. It's bound to pushing in the stick by default, which is very unideal for both d-pad and analogue stick.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Choosing a character</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose who you think looks cool!</li>
      <li>If you are new to fighting games, may think you know what strengths and weaknesses you want in a character but you should be flexible to try new things because you won't know what actually clicks for you</li>
      <li>Check the Strive website's characters tab or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST">dustloop.com</a> for general overviews of characters </li>
      <li>Strive has a few technical characters, namely Zato and Happy Chaos that have both a non-traditional gameplan and higher execution requirements before they are fully effective. Donâ€™t let that disincentivize you if you are interested in them, but be ready to invest more time before you start seeing the results you want to see.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mindset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><mark>You will lose a lot, especially getting started</mark></strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><mark>Losses are not a judgement of you</mark></strong>
      </li>
      <li>Losses are an opportunity to learn</li>
      <li>Being able to identify why you lost is difficult but the fastest way to improve as a player</li>
      <li>The common denominator across all of your matches is yourself, so spending time consciously practicing and training in matches/training mode is the primary way to see an overall improvement</li>
      <li>It is incredibly easy to waste time grinding matches. It is not uncommon for somebody to have 200 hours in the game and still have no clue what they are doing. That is not to say that grinding matches is bad, but for tangible improvements in a timely fashion you should be thinking about the game and have something you are aiming to practice with each match.</li>
    </ul>
