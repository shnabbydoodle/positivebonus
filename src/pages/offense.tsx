    <p>Blockstrings and mixups </p>
    <ul>
      <h2>Blockstrings</h2>
      <li>A “blockstring” is a sequence of attacks comprising of normals and specials that you use when the opponent is blocking. This differs from a combo since the opponent isn't getting hit, and the objective of a blockstring isn't to do damage but to make the opponent's defense crack while you don't leave yourself at disadvantage.</li>
      <li>Most characters can do a simple blockstring with Slash -&gt; Heavy Slash -&gt; Special</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Check <a href="dustloop.com">dustloop.com</a> to see which specials are good for blockstring purposes, since many specials are meant for combos and leave you very minus when blocked. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Alternatively, watch high level gameplay replays or check out the Strive community Discord and character main Discords for additional resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The sign of a good blockstring ender special is one that doesn't leave a big gap when cancelled from your HS normals and isn't very minus on block.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You'll get a feel for these with time and will learn most of these naturally through osmosis. However, if somebody mentions that a special is very minus on block, don't do it when the opponent is blocking.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>Offensive system mechanics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Red Roman Cancel</strong>: Costs half of your tension. Press any 3 buttons except for dust or the RC macro while an attack is connecting with an opponent to activate. Sends out a shockwave that hits the opponent on both hit and block, and cuts out your move's recovery. Use this to keep unsafe moves safe on block, or to extend a combo past the point where it is usually possible.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Abbreviated to RRC</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Please use this mechanic</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>“Alright, but my opponent is blocking everything! How do I land a hit?”-- enter <strong>mixups</strong>
      </li>
      <h2>Mixups</h2>
      <li>Mixups crack open a turtling opponent by forcing them to hedge their bets on one of your offensive options in a situation where you can do another one that beats their guess.</li>
      <li>Strive largely a “strike-throw” game. This means that most characters have a very effective mixup game alternating between striking with attacks and throwing the opponent, which bypasses blocking entirely. </li>
      <li>If the opponent sees a throw coming, they can respond in a few ways, namely:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Pressing one of their attacks to interrupt your throw attempt before you reach them</li>
        <li>“Teching” your throw by doing it back to you, effectively nullifying the throw</li>
        <li>Jumping into the air, where grounded throws will always whiff</li>
      </ul>
      <li>However, if they use these options when you did not go for throw and instead attacked:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Pressing one of their attacks will often get caught by your button, since they were reacting to a lull in your blockstring which means they are pressing their button on a delay. Your button is likely to be already well on its way to connecting when they start theirs.</li>
        <li>Throw techs only work against throws, and will result in a throw otherwise. You are likely out of range for the throw to connect if you are spaced at all, and will punish their whiffed throw with your button. Alternatively, your blockstring left a 1 frame gap whereas throws require 2 frames of startup, so your button will counterhit them.</li>
        <li>Jumping has 5 frames of jump startup where you cannot block. If your attack connects within the jump startup, you will simply hit them. Alternatively, if they left the ground successfully, your attack will often force them to block in the air, which leaves you at a large frame advantage.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If your opponent is expecting you to attack, they will block, in which case you can simply run up and throw them (assuming they do not react, which is more likely when you are close to them since you have less distance to close before being in throw range).</li>
      <li>Other mixups include high-low mixups (where the opponent needs to guess between blocking crouching for a low attack or blocking standing for an overhead), and left-right mixups (where the opponent needs to change their blocking direction to continue holding back against an attacker that has switched sides)</li>
      <li>An easy high-low mixup is to press 5D (neutral dust) after a button that can gatling into it for an overhead, or 2D for a low. Typically found after 2K, 5K, and c.S. These buttons gatling into both 5D and 2D, which must be blocked differently.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you hold 5D, you get a charged version of dust. If this hits the opponent, hold jump after the audio cue to do a homing jump. Press punch twice to do a short dust finisher combo for big damage. (There are more optimal combos but just try to land the finisher for now)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Okizeme</h2>
      <li>Okizeme means “wake up offense” and is the act and mindgames surrounding attacking an opponent as they get up after a knockdown.</li>
      <li>For starters, <strong>try to place your c.S on top of the opponent just as they become tangible again after a knockdown.</strong> This will force them to block on their wakeup and not immediately try to take their turn back, since you went through your entire attack startup during their inactionable wakeup animation and have an active hitbox on top of them as they regain control. </li>
    </ul>
