    <h1>Combos</h1>
    <p>Do cool stuff on hit! </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Fighting games are not about combos</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Don't obsess over combos</strong>

      <strong>Find the most basic “day 1 BNB” on <a href="dustloop.com">dustloop.com</a>
      </strong> and practice it in training mode until a decent level of consistency, then aim to land it mid match.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn on the virtual controller display if it isn't already on, and pay attention to your inputs if you are having trouble doing specific parts of a combo.</li>
      <li>Doing your inputs cleanly is key to consistency.</li>
      <li>You can probably press your gatlings and special cancels way earlier than you think.</li>
      <li>The unstable nature of a real match will challenge you to recognize when you have the opportunity to go into the combo, and you will need to pass the executional requirement of not dropping the combo on the fly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Different combos cover different situations, namely:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Metered vs meterless combos: Do you have 50 tension ready? If so, you can use Red Roman Cancels to extend combos past usual limits, or cancel a normal into a super to cash out more damage!</li>
      <li>Midscreen vs corner: Having the opponent against the wall in the corner means they can't get flung away from you during your combo. This allows every character to do optimized corner combos which deal more damage, and usually result in a wall break.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to read combo and write combo notation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Combo Notation may look something like AACHcs = cs &gt; DC623s~s~66 &gt; 2k &gt; 6h &gt; 236h~66 kara 236236&#91;p&#93;~&#93;p&#91;</li>
      <li> <strong>X</strong> is often used as a placeholder for a button, usually meaning anybutton works there</li>
      <li> <strong>&gt;</strong> means that that6 move cancels into the next move</li>
      <li> <strong>=</strong> means to link one button into the other, for more info on how this works see frame data</li>
      <li> <strong>kara</strong> this one is a more advanced technique and has its own section, see below</li>
      <li> <strong>CH</strong> stands for Counter Hit. This is when you see sparks aroudn the enemy when you hit them; and/or when the game slows down</li>
      <li> <strong>dl.</strong> stands for delay, meanign to delay the pressing of the next button, usually so that the move will not whiff</li>
      <li> <strong>DC</strong> This stands for Dash Cancel, this has more uses with kara cancels, once again see below for more info</li>
      <li> <strong>&#91;X&#93;</strong> and <strong>&#93;X&#91;</strong> These refer to holding down a button and releasing a buttons</li>
    </ul>
