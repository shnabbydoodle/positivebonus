      </strong> and practice it in training mode until a decent level of consistency, then aim to land it mid match.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn on the virtual controller display if it isn't already on, and pay attention to your inputs if you are having trouble doing specific parts of a combo.</li>
      <li>Doing your inputs cleanly is key to consistency.</li>
      <li>You can probably press your gatlings and special cancels way earlier than you think.</li>
      <li>The unstable nature of a real match will challenge you to recognize when you have the opportunity to go into the combo, and you will need to pass the executional requirement of not dropping the combo on the fly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Different combos cover different situations, namely:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Metered vs meterless combos: Do you have 50 tension ready? If so, you can use Red Roman Cancels to extend combos past usual limits, or cancel a normal into a super to cash out more damage!</li>
      <li>Midscreen vs corner: Having the opponent against the wall in the corner means they can't get flung away from you during your combo. This allows every character to do optimized corner combos which deal more damage, and usually result in a wall break.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to read combo and write combo notation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Combo Notation may look something like AA CH c.S, c.S &gt; dc.623S~S~66 &gt; 2K &gt; 6H &gt; 236H~66 kara 236236&#91;P&#93;~&#93;P&#91;</li>
      <li> <strong>X</strong> is often used as a placeholder for a button, usually meaning any button works there</li>
      <li> <strong>&gt;</strong> means that the first button gatlings/cancels into the next button</li>
      <li> <strong>,</strong> means to link one button into the other without a cancel but through utilizing frame advantage</li>
      <li> <strong>~</strong> usually means to perform the next button as a followup to the first one, most commonly seen in multi stage special moves</li>
      <li> <strong>kara</strong> stands for "empty cancel" which is when you cancel the first handful of startup frames of one move into another move. This is not a common thing to see in most combos.</li>
      <li> <strong>AA</strong> stands for Anti-Air, where the first hit needs to hit an airborne opponent</li>
      <li> <strong>CH</strong> stands for Counter Hit, for when your attack interrupts the startup of the opponent's attack</li>
      <li> <strong>dl.</strong> stands for delay, requiring a delay before pressing the next button, usually to adjust the height of the opponent</li>
      <li> <strong>dc.</strong> This stands for Dash Cancel, often utilized in conjunction with kara cancels to close the distance mid combo</li>
      <li> <strong>&#91;X&#93;</strong> and <strong>&#93;X&#91;</strong> These refer to holding down a button (denoted with [X]) and releasing a button (denoted with ]X[ )</li>
    </ul>
