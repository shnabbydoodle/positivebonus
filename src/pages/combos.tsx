      <li>Turn on the virtual controller display if it isn't already on, and pay attention to your inputs if you are having trouble doing specific parts of a combo.</li>
      <li>Doing your inputs cleanly is key to consistency.</li>
      <li>You can probably press your gatlings and special cancels way earlier than you think.</li>
      <li>The unstable nature of a real match will challenge you to recognize when you have the opportunity to go into the combo, and you will need to pass the executional requirement of not dropping the combo on the fly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Different combos cover different situations, namely:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Metered vs meterless combos: Do you have 50 tension ready? If so, you can use Red Roman Cancels to extend combos past usual limits, or cancel a normal into a super to cash out more damage!</li>
      <li>Midscreen vs corner: Having the opponent against the wall in the corner means they can't get flung away from you during your combo. This allows every character to do optimized corner combos which deal more damage, and usually result in a wall break.</li>
    </ul>
