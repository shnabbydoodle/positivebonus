<h1>FD, IB, IBFD, Deflect Shield</h1>


<ul>

<li>FD stands for Faultless Defense, which is a stronger variant of blocking.</li> 
<ul>
 
<li>Press and hold any two buttons besides dust while blocking. A blue bubble shield will appear around the character. This slowly drains your Tension gauge, but only when you are not actively in blockstun.</li>
 
<li>Faultless Defense increases the amount of pushback the attacker receives, granting the defender more space and by proxy, weakens strike-throw mixups since the attacker will need to cover more space. Faultless Defense can also disable many blockstrings, since gatlings and specials are more likely to whiff from the increased pushback.</li>
 
<li>Faultless Defense also disables chip damage, which can save your life especially at low health.</li> 
</ul>

<li>IB stands for Instant Block, which is a defensive technique tied to a timing minigame.</li> 
<ul>
 
<li>Tap block right as an attack connects (2 frame window), and your character will flash white and the game will display a popup reading “JUST!”</li>
 
<li>Instant Block completely disables pushback on the attacker, leaving them at the exact same distance they were before the attack was blocked. This makes a lot of slightly minus attacks unsafe on block, since the attacker will still be extremely close to the defender and potentially in throw range. Since throws have only 2 frames of startup, a well timed Instant Block can make most blockstring enders unsafe.</li>
 
<li>Instant Block also disables chip damage, which can save your life especially at low health but is generally riskier to fish for since there is only a 2 frame window.</li>
 
<li>Instant Block also grants the defender a small amount of tension.</li>
 
<li>Also referred to as Just Block or Just Guard</li> 
</ul>

<li>IBFD stands for Instant Block Faultless Defense, which is achieved by tapping Faultless Defense with the Instant Block timing.</li> 
<ul>
 
<li>Still only a 2 frame window, but the effects of Instant Block and Faultless Defense will visually overlap.</li>
 
<li>IBFD greatly increases the amount of pushback the attacker receives, granting the defender a dramatic amount of space to work with.</li>
 
<li>The benefits are largely the same as FD, but to a much higher degree.</li> 
</ul>

<li>Deflect Shield is a mechanic tied to 50% burst gauge, and appears as an orange bubble surrounding the player.</li> 
<ul>
 
<li>Inputting 214D will have your character perform a special where they spawn an orange bubble that blocks highs and lows automatically, but loses to throws.</li>
 
<li>An opponent striking the shield is sent dramatically far away, even more than IBFD. The benefits are largely the same as IBFD, but to a higher degree and much easier executionally since there is no timing tied to it.</li>
 
<li>Since this is a special move and not a block, it has counterhit recovery after the bubble disappears. Be careful for this when using Deflect Shield, since the distinct visual and audio queue telegraphs its activation and the opponent may hesitate to strike it if they aren’t already committed to a gatling.</li>
 
<li>Occasionally abbreviated to DS</li>
