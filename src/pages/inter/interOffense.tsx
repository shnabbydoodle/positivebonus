    <h1>Intermediate Offensive Theory</h1>
    <p>Opening people up without a setup</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With the right sequence in offense, you can open up the opponent without explicitly going for a mixup</li>
      <li>Incorporating slow but plus attacks on block, also known as “pressure resets” can force the opponent to take their turn back proactively instead of waiting for a minus attack to end the turn naturally.</li>
      <li>A frame trap is when two attacks have a tiny window between them where the defender can act. This “traps” the defender since the window is not large enough for their attack to become active, and it gets counterhit during startup. In Strive, frametraps are most often found between gatlings.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST">dustloop.com</a> often lists normals that frametrap naturally out of others.
        </li>
        <li>Frametraps almost always lose to moves with invincibility on them, since the startup speed of the attack does not matter if invincibility can allow the defender to phase through the second attack.</li>
        <li>To incentivize your opponent mashing on frametraps, mix in other options such as throw and pressure resets that punish the opponent for simply blocking.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Establishing a rock-paper-scissors situation in your pressure and rotating your options regularly is the essence of having a strong offensive game that has effective responses to your opponent’s habits.</li>
    </ul>
