    <h1>Blue Roman Cancel, Purple Roman Cancel</h1>

<li><strong>Blue Roman Cancel</strong>: Costs half of your tension. Press any 3 buttons except for dust or press the RC macro while not attacking or defending. Sends out an aura that slows down time within its radius. Use this to slow down your opponent and counterattack correctly if they are committed to any action.</li> 
<ul>
 
<li>You can also Blue Roman Cancel out of your backdash animation to cut its total duration down while still capitalizing on the frontloaded invulnerability frames. </li>  
<ul>
  
<li>Backdashes that have the character leave the ground or hop backwards can be Blue Roman Cancelled with a forward drift, allowing for a very fast overhead with a punch or kick that starts with a backdash.</li>
  
<li>Abbreviated to BRC</li>  
</ul> 
</ul>

<li><strong>Purple Roman Cancel</strong>: Costs half of your tension. Press any 3 buttons except for dust or the RC macro while attacking but not actively hitting the opponent. Most commonly used after a move whiffs, before it hits active frames, or after a fireball. Sends out an aura that slows down time within its radius, but less than BRC. Use this to cancel out of a whiffed attack, to cancel the startup of an attack, or to follow up after a fireball. Can also be used similarly to BRC to respond to the opponents option by utilizing the slow motion.</li>
