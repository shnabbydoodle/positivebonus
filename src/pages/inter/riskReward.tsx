<h1>Risk/Reward</h1>


<ul>

<li>Risk/Reward refers to the potential loss of momentum, health, or other resource versus the potential gain when committing to any action.</li>

<li><mark>Risk/Reward is what makes the mindgames in fighting games more complicated than rock-paper-scissors-- although a lot of interactions are resolved through a trifecta of options that cyclically beat each other, the risk/reward associated with each option dynamically changes throughout the game, and the judgement of that is left up to the individual player.</mark></li>

<li>Both risk and reward are not inherently tied to HP-- resources such as burst, tension, character specific gauges, screen space, and frame advantage are all just as, if not more important, than HP.</li>

<li><strong>All of the following examples can have different risk/reward evaluations depending on the gamestate. The following is looking at options in a vacuum:</strong></li> 
<ul>
 
<li>Low risk, low reward: walking, running, blocking, small buttons such as Punches with low recovery.</li>
 
<li>High risk, high reward: big haymaker attacks, using an invincible super on wakeup, airdashing, mixups that are interruptable or unsafe on block</li>
 
<li>High risk, low reward: random DPs, using unsafe specials in neutral, flailing without intent</li>
 
<li>Low risk, high reward: not a common sight in modern fighting games. However, if someone is unprepared to deal with an option you have, it could fall under this category.</li>
 
<li>If somebody is 1 HP and even chip damage from a special is enough to kill them, suddenly an unsafe special in neutral is no longer high risk, low reward but instead high risk, high reward since if they interact with it at all besides blocking with FD, they will die and the round will be over.</li>
